Determinitic dataflow programming
	- stream
	- ping-Ã´ng example
	-batch versus incremental 
	- producer consumer
	- multiple readers
	- filter and Map 
	- Agent


choise of each step wich thread is "nondeterminism"
separatecomponant that makes choices
	-> programmer not in control
	-> thread independent

choises should not break the program. This is the main difficulty with concurrency

Exectuion tree
	-> summary of all possible choices in one diagram
	-> example 

-> see ping-pong example 
	-naive solution relying on the scheduler, doesn't work 
	-threads need to synchronize
	-shared channel between threads
		-> stream = list with unbound taill an extended it by birding
	- we used token passsing technique 

Agent is a recursive finctopn in a thread tail recursive -> stack does not grow during the execution
	Input : stream(s)
	Output : stream(s)
